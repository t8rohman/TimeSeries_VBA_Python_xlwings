# TimeSeries_VBA_Python_xlwings
Analyzing components of time series with level, trend, and seasonality elements automatically and doing the forecast. I use the xlwings module so the user can interact with Python module using Excel as the UI. There are several ways to forecast including Smooth, Holt, and Winter's Exponential Smoothing. There are 5 files inside this repository:

1. 1 main file for the .xlsm (excel macro) file
2. 1 bas files for the VBA script to run the Python code and doing some formatting inside excel files
3. 1 python script files (.py) for the script that contains all the module needed for VBA to run
3. 2 files for data test to try running the main file

Credits for xlwings team for creating a wonderful module so we can run a Python script from Excel.
